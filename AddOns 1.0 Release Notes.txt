Black Market revamp
- Ships no longer spawn in origin sectors. 
  - They will now spawn in unknown sectors first if there are 3 or more unknown sectors, then in any random non-Xenon sector otherwise.
  - Renegade sector and the player's current sector (where the player is currently located) are excluded.
- To prevent savescumming, random ship types are determined upon game start.
  - This has the side effect of taking a few more seconds of setup upon starting the game. This is normal.
- There is now a grace period to claim a black market ship before the AI is allowed to do so.
  - This grace period is 4 hours on easy, 3 hours on normal, and 2 hours on hard. In all cases, there's a +/- 30 minute randomness to the grace period.
  - If the AI claims the ship, you will hear a "mission aborted" message play.
- Reason for updating the black market:
  - Was too easy to claim ships without any pressure, especially in known space. 
    Making it unknown space (no longer reveals the sector in the galaxy map) encourages the player to explore.
  - Adds flavor to black market ships, simulating that black market ships were acquired via dirty means.
  - Puts pressure on the player to claim the ship ASAP before others can steal it. True to its name, it's a black market.

		CHANGES
-----------------------------------------

- If you manage to successfully capture (board or bail) a Xenon or Pirate ship while you're doing your ascension, it will count towards ascension. 
- Also, a bailed ship will now give you its bounty, if it had any upon bailing.

	. ZH.Task.PirateWarlord.xml
	. Mayhem.Task.BailMaybe.xml

- Black Market and Abandoned Ships now spawn in with 40-70% hull.
  - Reason for this change: gives abandoned ships flavor, as they're meant to be derelicts.

	. Mayhem.GameCreator.AbandonedShips.xml

- During a Xenon crisis, NPC factions can no longer build factories on top of the player's fleet, if the player joined the OCV (needs verification)
  - Reason for this change: prevents NPCs from building on top of the player during a Xenon crisis. (There are no Xenon or player claims during a Xenon crisis.)
    This is because the player is part of the Xenon at this point, 
    and enemies of the Xenon are not allowed to build in their territories if Xenon capships are present.

	. Mayhem.Monitor.Autopopulate.Station.xml

- Pirate contract finally revamped. Joining the OCV voids any protections that the pirate contract would've given.
  - Updated perk description to state that joining the OCV voids a pirate contract.
  - Reason for this change: Xenon/OCV don't make deals with organics. 
    This is part 2 of voiding the pirate contract in an OCV playthrough; part 1 was disabling the +20 fighting from marines.

- You can now get Terran marines from your outposts.
  - Reason for this change: this calls the GetCommonwealth library script - for reusability.

	. Menu.DWM.Set.Hangar.xml

- When choosing a sector to invade, NPC battle groups now factor in your outpost's faster research and extra support perks, if those perks are unlocked.
  - Reason for this change: NPC targeting should target based on what the player has. Cripple their research, based on their actual research rate.

	. ZH.CI.SelectTarget.xml

- Terran memory sectors now count properly as Terran dejures.
  - Terrans prioritize Terran memory sectors over official dejure.
  - When non-Terran factions want to steal from Terrans, they take Terran memories into consideration.
  - Reason for this change: Terrans are the only faction who do not have dejure ownership in their starting territories.

	. ZH.Get.DejureSectors.xml

- Phanon and player relations are now set to friend when doing the Phanon plot.
  - Reason: allows jump beacon and satellite retention once Phanon have sectors.
    This is the same idea as how Xenon and player are friends with each other in a Xenon playthrough.

	. ZH.Monitor.xml

- When joining the Xenon/OCV, you now lose any perks related to maintenance, insurance, food, diplomacy, and interorbital storage.
  - Added comments to Mayhem.Perk.Init.xml for reference.

		FIXES
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed recycling returning a flat amount of research points rather than up to 85% (50% for advanced ships) for research projects.
  - This bug was introduced in Renegades 5.4.

	. Mayhem.Recycle.xml

- Fixed a typo in Renegade challenge questions.
  - This bug was introduced in Renegades 5.4.

	. Renegades.Plot.Challenge.xml

- Fixed % chance logic when a renegade kills a satellite.
  - Checks if a randomly generated number is 0 instead of being less than 3. RNG generates a random number between 0 to 3.
  - The functionality is the same, but I'm not 100% sure what is the maximum value that the game uses when generating between 0 to N (had conflicts between N or N-1).

	. Renegades.Task.Renegade.xml

- Fixed OCV virus timer now properly randomizes between -X seconds to +X seconds.
  - Reason: Before, it would randomize between 0 to +X seconds. The random value between X and Y function does not allow negative numbers to be returned.

	. Mayhem.Task.OCVVirus.xml

- Fixed Repair Target command not repairing abandoned ships.
  - Command will now be canceled if the ship is no longer yours or abandoned.
  - Reason: If you claim the ship, you will get a pop-up message that the repair was canceled. This is intended, as only the player's ships can be on standby mode.
    - Issue the "standby" command to the newly claimed ship and restart the repair target command.
    - Neutral ships are exempted from the standby command requirement because they do not have any other commands and cannot be issued a standby command. 
      Their only task is that they're waiting to be claimed.
  
	. Mayhem.RepairTarget.xml
	. Mayhem.Cmd.RepairTarget.xml

- Fixed Xenon and Pirate kill counters incrementing after ascension was completed.
  - Now increments only during ascension.
	
	. !ship.signal.killed.xml

- Removed comment regarding 3x population growth interacting with terraforming (comment left behind from 5.4)
